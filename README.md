## Overview

### The challenge

The server should be able to:

- Subscribe users to a chat room of their choice 
- Allow users to enter a room with a custom nickname.
- Allow users to chat with other users within the room.
- Keep a tally of room data like active users, room name, user profile pics

## My process
I love express because it's so lightweight and fast to get setup. This was my first project with Socket.io and I found it similar to Express: great documentation and fast setup. 

I dove into understanding WebSockets as a two-way interactive communication session allowing fast  event driven response cyles between server and client. Perfect for real time chat apps. 

### Built with

- Express
- Socket.io
- CORS

### What I learned
*SOCKET.io*: The power of websockets! The fast, interactive, event-driven nature of WebSockets feels intuitive to me and introduces so many exciting possibilities than traditional HTTP request/response cylces. I feel as though I learned the introductory concepts behind WebSockets and that I would be comfortable working with them again and implementing basic two-way sessions in future apps.     
### Continued development
There is a lot to this app that could be expanded like adding persistant data storage, user authentication, profiles, private messaging, and more. I may try adding voice chat at some point to learn more about modern browser media capabilities.
